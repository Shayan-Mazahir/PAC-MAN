# PAC-MAN
- This repository contains my PAC-MAN game which I made for my computer's (ICS3U) final assignment. 

## Where was this originally ran?
- This game was made, tested, de-bugged and finalized on [repl.it](https://replit.com/).

## Purpose
- This was an assignment for my computer ICS3U class, I chose to do PAC-MAN mainly because sir said no one was able to complete the game and I wanted to make history... And I did.... to some extend....

## Details
- Inspired from the original [PACMAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man).
- Template given by my sir, running using [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/) / [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## Development
- Now, this game is not perfect. I made this game in under two weeks with very weak basics of p5.js/processing.py and a bit of help from GPT-3. There are bugs such as ghosts getting stuck on places, and the homescreen not working on the first click and so on. But this was enough at the time so that I chould easily achieve more than the required tasks for a Level 4+(A+) grade, which I did.

## Future?
- Currently I am learning Java, after when I am done with it, I will start to work on this game slowly again, this project is not abandoned; it's just me learning a new Language and taking a break from Python.

## Colaborations?
- Feel free to fork and collaborate on this project, I look forward to see other people ideas on this!
