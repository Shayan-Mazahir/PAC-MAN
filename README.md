# PAC-MAN

## Overview
This repository contains the code for my PAC-MAN game, a project I developed during my Grade 11 and 12 ISU (Independent Study Unit). It showcases my progress in game development using two different programming languages.

## Project Details

### Languages
- **Python**: The version created in Grade 11 is written in Python and can be found [here](https://github.com/Shayan-Mazahir/PAC-MAN/tree/main/pacman-python).  
- **Java/Processing**: The version created in Grade 12 uses Java and Processing, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Shayan-Mazahir/PAC-MAN/tree/main/pacman-java). This version is actively being worked on.

### Current Status
- **Java/Processing Version**: Currently under active development.
- **Python Version**: Development has been paused, primarily because I lost interest in continuing it and I am not an expert in Python.

## Future Plans
I will try my best to work on this game, it is a really interesting project and I hope to finish it one day.
