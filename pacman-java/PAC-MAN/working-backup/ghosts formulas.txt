1. Blinky (Red Ghost) - "Chase"

Blinky’s formula is relatively simple: he always chases Pac-Man, regardless of his current mode.
Formula:

    Target: (xpacman,ypacman)(xpacman​,ypacman​)

    Movement: Move toward Pac-Man’s position using vector math:
    Direction=atan2(ypacman−yblinky,xpacman−xblinky)
    Direction=atan2(ypacman​−yblinky​,xpacman​−xblinky​)

    where atan2(dy, dx) gives the angle from Blinky’s current position to Pac-Man’s position.

    In Scatter Mode: Move toward the top-right corner (27, 0).
    Target=(27,0)
    Target=(27,0)


2. Pinky (Pink Ghost) - "Chase (Offset)"

Pinky’s behavior is to target a position ahead of Pac-Man. In Chase Mode, he targets the spot 4 tiles ahead of Pac-Man, based on Pac-Man’s current direction.
Formula:

    Target (Chase Mode):
    Target=(xpacman+4⋅directionx,ypacman+4⋅directiony)
    Target=(xpacman​+4⋅directionx​,ypacman​+4⋅directiony​)

    where direction_x and direction_y are Pac-Man's current movement vectors.

    In Scatter Mode: Move toward the top-left corner (0, 0).
    Target=(0,0)
    Target=(0,0)


3. Inky (Cyan Ghost) - "Chase (Combination)"

Inky’s behavior combines both Blinky’s position and a position ahead of Pac-Man, making his movement more complex.
Formula:

    Target (Chase Mode):
    Target=(xblinky+2⋅directionx,yblinky+2⋅directiony)
    Target=(xblinky​+2⋅directionx​,yblinky​+2⋅directiony​)

    where:
        (xblinky,yblinky)(xblinky​,yblinky​) is Blinky’s position.
        (xpacman,ypacman)(xpacman​,ypacman​) is Pac-Man’s position.
        The offset is based on both Blinky’s position and Pac-Man’s direction.

    In Scatter Mode: Move toward the bottom-right corner (27, 31).
    Target=(27,31)
    Target=(27,31)


4. Clyde (Orange Ghost) - "Chase/Scatter"

Clyde behaves differently depending on how close he is to Pac-Man. When he is too close (within 8 tiles), he switches to Scatter Mode and moves toward his home corner.
Formula:

    Target (Chase Mode):
        If distance to Pac-Man >8>8:
        Target=(xpacman,ypacman)
        Target=(xpacman​,ypacman​)
        If distance to Pac-Man ≤8≤8:
        Target=(0,31)
        Target=(0,31)

    In Scatter Mode: Move toward the bottom-left corner (0, 31).
    Target=(0,31)
    Target=(0,31)
